    <h2>Encrypted Wallet Load Test</h2>
    <p>This page will help you test loading the encrypted wallet and see console output.</p>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Open index.html in your browser</li>
        <li>Open Developer Console (F12)</li>
        <li>Click "Restore Wallet" button</li>
        <li>Select the encrypted wallet file: <code>debug-service/examples/FIXED_ENC_alpha1qllh_axta7d_wif.txt</code></li>
        <li>Enter password: <code>123456</code></li>
        <li>Click "Load" button</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Expected Behavior:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>✅ The restore modal should close immediately after loading</li>
        <li>✅ The wallet address should be displayed in the main UI</li>
        <li>✅ A success notification should appear: "Encrypted Wallet Loaded"</li>
        <li>✅ The balance should start loading if connected to Fulcrum</li>
        <li>✅ No "scanning" or waiting - immediate display</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Previous Issue:</h3>
    <p>Before the fix, encrypted standard wallets would not close the modal or show the UI immediately. The wallet would appear to be "scanning" silently without any visible progress.</p>
