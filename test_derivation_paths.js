// - Expected pubkey hash (from address): a2587fc71930d36792913964ed71279e517397f

// But we don't have the master private key because it's encrypted

// The user said changing from testnet to mainnet "was not the thing"
// So the issue must be elsewhere

// Possibility 1: The wallet is using a non-standard derivation
// Possibility 2: The index.html is not properly extracting/using the master key
// Possibility 3: The address at index 0 is not what we expect

// Let me check what happens in our current flow:

console.log('1. extractFromWalletDat looks for "walletdescriptorkey"');
console.log('2. jerome.dat has 0 "walletdescriptorkey" (keys are encrypted)');
console.log('3. Falls back to legacy extraction looking for "key" pattern');
console.log('4. Legacy extraction likely finds wrong keys or fails');

console.log('The issue is that jerome.dat:');
console.log('- IS a descriptor wallet (has "walletdescriptor")');
console.log('- IS a BIP32 HD wallet (has master xpub at depth 0)');
console.log('- Has ENCRYPTED keys (has "mkey", no "walletdescriptorkey")');
console.log('');

console.log('So the extraction should fail with an error about encrypted wallet');
console.log('But the user says they can "recover other wallets successfully"');

console.log('This suggests either:');
console.log('1. The user has a way to decrypt the wallet (provides password)');
console.log('2. The wallet file is in a special state (partially decrypted?)');
console.log('3. There is a bug where wrong key is extracted but still "works"');
